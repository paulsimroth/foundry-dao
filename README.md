# Foundry DAO

1. This project has a contract controlled by a DAO
2. Every Transacation that this DAO wants to send has to be voted on
3. This project uses ERC20 Tokens for voting

This project consists of a set of Solidity smart contracts for implementing a decentralized governance system. It includes contracts for managing a token with voting rights, a governor contract for executing proposals, and a timelock controller for enforcing a delay between proposal submission and execution. These contracts leverage OpenZeppelin libraries for secure and efficient governance functionalities.
